# 🌐 Responsive Web Development Journey

This repository is a day-by-day record of my progress in mastering the core pillars of web development: **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🚀 The Mission
My goal is to build websites that aren't just functional, but are fully **responsive**—meaning they look and work great on every device, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

## 📁 Repository Organization
I follow a chronological learning path. Each file represents a specific day of practice:
* **HTML Days:** Focus on semantic structure and content.
* **CSS Days:** Focus on layouts, Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries.
* **JS Days:** Focus on logic and interactivity.

*Example: `Day 23.html` contains the specific concepts I tackled on my 23rd day of coding.*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Workflow:** Git & GitHub via Windows PowerShell/Git Bash
- **Environment:** VS Code
